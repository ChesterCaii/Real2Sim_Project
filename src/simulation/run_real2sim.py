Real-to-Simulation Pipeline - Final Demo
=========================================

This script loads the combined Franka Panda robot and reconstructed bunny mesh
into a single MuJoCo physics simulation.

Usage:
    mjpython run_real2sim.py

Requirements:
    - MuJoCo Python bindings
    - mujoco_menagerie (Franka robot models)
    - bunny_final.stl (reconstructed mesh)
